## Description 

I developed this app to showcase my progress since the beginning of this course. I used React to build my portfolio, and the combination of React and Bootstrap saved me time. During the development process, I was confused regarding the project component, and later, I faced challenges while styling the projects. Fortunately, my tutor provided guidance. The projects component is where my apps are going to be displayed, and I import them onto the portfolio page. Once I achieved this, I encountered difficulties in styling the projects in a grid format. After spending some time, I eventually found the correct placement for my classes to ensure the projects were in the right position.

However, my major struggle revolved around the design of my portfolio. I aimed to create something unique and wanted to incorporate additional elements to bring more life to my portfolio. In the future, I plan to make changes to the design and color scheme.
